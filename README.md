# TinkerTrap

TinkerTrap is built-for-purpose development platform designed to overcome the restrictions of commercial camera traps, while maintaining essential camera trap functionality. It is open-source, low cost, and operates as a traditional camera trap out of the box. For those with the need, it is also modular and fully programmable, capable of using multiple trigger methods, custom sensors and peripherals, various power sources, and wireless communication.
